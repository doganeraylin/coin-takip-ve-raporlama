### Description

* the project is a coin tracker app built with **Vue**, **Vuex** and **CSS**. 
* it allows users to add stocks by clicking on the "Add Stock" button, which displays a list of coins. 
* users can then increment and decrement the count of each coin, and filter the list by coin name using the search bar. 
* coins can be removed by clicking on the "Remove" button. 
* the added coins are listed on the "Portfolio" page and are stored in local storage. 
* the number of coins and the names of the coins are reflected in a pie chart, which is built using **Chart.js**. 
* the app automatically refreshes every 20 minutes to ensure the portfolio and chart are up-to-date. 
* there is also a "Refresh" button to manually update the portfolio and chart. 
* additionally, there is an "Update" button for updating the count of a coin in the portfolio.
